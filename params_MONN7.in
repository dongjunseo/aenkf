! Observation error variance in mm^2 for 6-hr mean areal precipitation (MAP).
! Used for homoscedastic option only and ignored for the default 
! heteroscedastic option.
100.
! Observation error variance in mm^2 for 6-hr mean areal potential evapo-
! transpiration (MAPE). Used for homoscedastic option only.
100.
! (Pseudo-) observation error variance in mm^2 for 6-hr runoff depth, i.e.,
! the Total Channel Inflow (TCI) in SAC.
100.
! Observation error variance in cms^2 for instantaneous discharge.
625.
! Ensemble size (i.e., the number of ensemble members used).
200
! Number of streamflow observations used within the assimilation window. For
! SACUH, the default is 1.
1
! Sampling frequency of streamflow observations to be assimilated. For SACUH,
! the default is 1.
1
! Random number seed.
11111
! Option for subdivision of the assimilation window for construction of
! a higher temporal-resolution control vector. If this option is set to 0, no
! subdivision is used and the control vectors for MAP, MAPE and TCI are
! adjusted uniformly over the entire assimilation window. if this option is
! set to a positive integer, it specifies the length of the equally subdivided
! window in hrs. The default is 0, i.e., do not subdivide.
0 
! Perturbation factor for cold data assimilation (DA) run. The Default for
! SACUH is 0.01, i.e., the variance of the perturbation is 1% of value of
! the state variable.
0.01
! Perturbation factor for warm DA run. The default for SACUH is 0.01.
